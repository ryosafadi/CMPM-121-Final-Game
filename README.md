# CMPM-121-Final-Game

## Devlog Entry - [11/15/2024]

## Introducing the team

Tools Lead: Ryo Safadi

Engine Lead: Mitchell Tai

Design Co-Leads: Arno Wu, Patrick James Alcantara

## Tools and materials

1. We would like to build the game using the Phaser Library. We think that Phaser is a good choice for the 2D grid-based game we plan to make, and we all have experience developing with Phaser. We would also get the chance to practice and apply what we learned from both CMPM120 and CMPM121.

2. We will either use Typescript or JavaScript for the programming language, and JSON as the data language since we are planning to use Phaser. These programming languages and data language are well-supported by Phaser, which is the main reason why we chose them.

3. We will use VScode for this project, and maybe Aseprite for creating visual assets. We all have experience with VScode and some of its tools, so it seemed like the best choice for an IDE. As for Aseprite, it seems like a relatively straightforward yet valuable tool, so we want to learn more about it.

4. For an alternate platform, we plan to switch from Javascript to Typescript or vice versa, depending on which of the two languages we choose to start with. 

## Outlook

For this game project, our goal is to try to create a 2D grid on the surface of a planet that “exists” in 3D space. This means that the player will only see a portion of the planet that can be represented in two dimensions, but the planet can also “spin” so that the player can explore more of it, one chunk at a time. We plan to do this by creating the illusion of a third dimension through visuals. This will most likely be the hardest part of our project to implement, but we believe that it will help pique our players’ interests if successful. This challenge will also give us the chance to improve our collaboration skills and put what we’ve learned in CMPM 120 and 121 into practice.
